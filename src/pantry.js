// Pantries
// Every User should have a pantry. A Pantry holds on to all the ingredients its owner has stocked, and the amount of each ingredient they have. As a user, I should be able to:

// Determine whether my pantry has enough ingredients to cook a given meal
// Determine the amount of ingredients still needed to cook a given meal, based on whatâ€™s in my pantry
// Remove the ingredients used for a given meal from my pantry, once that meal has been cooked (only applicable if users have a list of mealsToCook; can be considered a stretch goal)
