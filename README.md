# What's Cookin

## Abstract
What's Cookin is a recipe application. It generates a random user on load and displays a series of recipe cards with a title and picture. You can click the card to get more info on the recipe (instructions, ingredients etc), you can favorite recipes, or add them to 'Recipes to Cook'. You can search recipes by tag, title, or ingredient. 
A big focus of this project was building an application using several different classes each responsible for it's own set of properties and methods. Testing these classes was also a priority.
